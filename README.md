A simple python script to get the alert on vaccine slot availablity on a particular PIN code in India. Upon finding the slots in your area, ```warning.mp3``` will be played to get your attention so that you can book the appointments.

## Prerequisites
The Code is written in Python 3.8. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. 

To install pip run in the command Line
```
python -m ensurepip -- default-pip 
``` 
to upgrade it
```
python -m pip install -- upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```
to upgrade Python
```
pip install python -- upgrade
```
**Important**
Shoot this command to install additional required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Script
Open Terminal or Command Prompt and type
```
python individual_vaccine_slot_finder.py -p 125053
```
Running this script will continuously check for available slot in the PIN code 125053.

### Required Argument
  **-p PINCODE, --pincode PINCODE** 
 - PIN Code to look for vaccination slots.

### Optional Arguments
  **-h, --help**
- show this help message and exit
  
 **-a [18,45], --minAge [18,45]**
- Minimum age to find the slots for. Default is 18.

 **-d DATE, --date DATE** 
-  Date on which you want to find the slots. Format - '16-05-2021'

## Does this even work?
Getting an appointment for vaccination is a huge challenging in my area. I have been able get the vaccination with my entire family just because of the script. I am using a scalable version of the same script to get the slots availability alert for my near and dear ones. So yes, it works at the time of latest commit.

## Found it useful?
Please book the appointment for one who doesn't have the access to internet. They need it the most.

## Troubleshooting
The www.cowin.gov.in's server will block your request after some time if you continue to send request using the same IP address. To tackle it, some free proxies from ```proxies.py``` are randomaly being rotated in a random time interval. Feel free to add some more to keep the script running.
